# Summary

Over the last year, I've been asked the same question over and over again.

> How do I get started with embedded software development?

I usually tell people to go buy an Arduino, throw away the Arduino IDE and libraries, and figure out how to blink a light using just the AVR toolchain.  
This "book" is designed to teach you how to do exactly that, and then move on to the other basics of embedded software dev that you need to know to start your journey.

For this course, we'll use an [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3/) because of it's ubuity and availability.  
Feel free to purchase a clone, personally, I like the [SparkFun Redboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13975), but many different Uno clones are available for as little as $10.
You'll also need a small breadboard, some jumpers, leds, resistors, capacitors, buttons, and other odds and ends to get the most out of this.  
I recommend something like [Adafruit's Parts Pal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2975) kit or [SparkFun's Beginners Parts Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13973) and [Half Sized Breadboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12002).  
We're not going to cover electronics at any depth, but we will need to wire up a few simple circuits.
